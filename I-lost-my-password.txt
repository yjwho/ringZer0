** I Lost My Password Can You Find It? **
by jhoohoo

1. After downloading and extracting the file, look into the folders

2. In Policies\{75DE8F0A-DEC0-441F-AE29-90DFAFCF632B}\User\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
The content is:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}">
        <User clsid="{DF5F1855-51E5-4d24-8B1A-D9BDE98BA1D1}" 
            name="Administrator (built-in)" 
            image="1" 
            changed="2014-02-06 19:33:28" 
            uid="{C73C0939-38FB-4287-AC48-478F614F5EF7}" 
            userContext="0" removePolicy="0">
                <Properties action="R" 
                            fullName="Administrator" 
                            description="Administrator" 
                            cpassword="PCXrmCkYWyRRx3bf+zqEydW9/trbFToMDx6fAvmeCDw" 
                            changeLogon="0" 
                            noChange="0" 
                            neverExpires="1" 
                            acctDisabled="0" 
                            subAuthority="" 
                            userName="Administrator (built-in)"/>
        </User>
    </Groups>

3. Noticed how the cpassword leaks the password for the Administrator?
    cpassword="PCXrmCkYWyRRx3bf+zqEydW9/trbFToMDx6fAvmeCDw"

4. I Googled "Group Policy passwords" and found https://adsecurity.org/?p=2288

    The article says that "In 2006, Microsoft Bought Desktop Standard’s “PolicyMaker” which 
    they re-branded & released with Windows Server 2008 as “Group Policy Preferences.” One of 
    the most useful features of Group Policy Preferences (GPP) is the ability to store and 
    use credentials in several scenarios, including "Change local Administrator passwords".

    The article also says that "When a new GPP is created, there’s an associated XML file 
    created in SYSVOL with the relevant configuration data and if there is a password 
    provided, it is AES-256 bit encrypted."

    However, "at some point prior to 2012, Microsoft published the AES private key on 
    MSDN which can be used to decrypt the password."

5. That pointed me to the MSDN doc 
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/232e3242-e88a-45b5-a02f-dede30917279?redirectedfrom=MSDN#published-version
    
    In this doc, I found this:

    The 32-byte AES key is as follows:
    4e 99 06 e8 fc b6 6c c9 fa f4 93 10 62 0f fe e8
    f4 96 e8 06 cc 05 79 90 20 9b 09 a4 33 b6 6c 1b

6. I wrote the following python code to get the decrypted password:

    import base64
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES

    cpassword = b'PCXrmCkYWyRRx3bf+zqEydW9/trbFToMDx6fAvmeCDw='
    print(cpassword)
    cpass_64 = base64.b64decode(cpassword)
    key = b'\x4e\x99\x06\xe8\xfc\xb6\x6c\xc9\xfa\xf4\x93\x10\x62\x0f\xfe\xe8\xf4\x96\xe8\x06\xcc\x05\x79\x90\x20\x9b\x09\xa4\x33\xb6\x6c\x1b'
    IV = b'\x00' * 16
    print(IV)
    flag = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV).decrypt(cpass_64)
    print(flag)
    flag.decode('utf-16')

7. The result is:
    LocalRoot!ఌఌఌఌఌఌ

8. I had to remove the 6 special characters to get the correct flag.
