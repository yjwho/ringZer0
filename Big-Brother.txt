The prompt says: Even Google cannot find this one

1. I saw the prompt and Googled "pages Google can't find"

2. The top result is "Why is my page missing from Google Search?"
    https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7474347?hl=en

3. The page explains how Google Search works. The short version is through crawling, 
    indexing, serving (and ranking). There's also option to view the long version. Click
    that.

4. In the long version under Crawling, it states: "Crawling is the process by which 
    Googlebot visits new and updated pages to be added to the Google index. ..."
    It also tells you "How does Google know which pages not to crawl?"

5. The first bullet point under that states:
    "Pages blocked in robots.txt won't be crawled, but still might be indexed if linked 
    to by another page. (Google can infer the content of the page by a link pointing to 
    it, and index the page without parsing its contents.)"

6. Ah!!!! robots.txt!

7. I typed this in the url:
    https://ringzer0ctf.com/robots.txt

8. The page only contains:
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/

9. So we go there: https://ringzer0ctf.com/16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/ and there's
    the Flag!!!
