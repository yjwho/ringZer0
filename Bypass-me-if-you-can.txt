** Bypass me if you can **

1. To read about what SQL Injection is, this is a nice little article about it:
    https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection
    (I had to read this because I'm very familiar with SQL but had never heard of 
    SQL Injection attacks)

2. Then I tried putting "' OR 1=1 --" for the Username, thinking "--" will make 
    the Password condition a comment

3. I got this error:
    You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your 
    MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' AND password = ''' at 
    line 1

4. I realized that it must not have recognized the comment's syntax "--" since it's 
    complaining about the syntax for the password property

5. Then I tried "' OR 1=1 #" and I'm logged in!
