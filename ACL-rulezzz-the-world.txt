1. We see a drop-down box with three options. Select any option and click "List user",
    you will see the Username, Group, and Description of the Username you selected.
    Therefore, the SQL query probably look something like this:
    SELECT Username, Group, Description FROM some_table
        WHERE Username = 'charles'

3. Since we can't directly change any text, we might be able to change the values through
    the "inspect..." from our browser.
    
4. Select whichever one of the three usernames, hover over the element, right click, 
    and click "inspect..."

5. We probably want to exploit this by having it show us a bunch of entries that weren't
    among the default options ("admin", "charles", and "cedrick").

6. Edit any of the option's value and change it to something like "' OR 'a'='a", 
    where 'a'='a' is always true. Make sure to include a single quote at the very 
    beginning to close the first condition, and exlude the single quote after the second
    'a'.

7. Select the option that you edited and click "List user".

8. A lot of entries that wasn't on there before popped up, and many of them has the FLAG.
