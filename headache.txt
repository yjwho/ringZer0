** Headache **

Prompt: Answer is closer than you think!

1. The name of the challenge and the prompt make me wonder if the Flag is at the heading
    of the HTML or the header of the HTTP protocol.

2. Checked the heading. Didn't find anything useful. Now go look at the header.

3. I use Chrome, and there's a Network tab under inspect...

4. This page from Chrome DevTools explain how to get the header
    https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/?utm_source=devtools&utm_campaign=2019Q1#open

5. The steps I took are:
    1) right click the refresh button on my browser and select "Empty cashe and Hard Reload"
    2) Scroll to the top of the requests and click the earliest request made (43 is the name)
    3) Select the "Header" tab
    4) Scroll down to the Response Headers and the Flag is one of the properties!
