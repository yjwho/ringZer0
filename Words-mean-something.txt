Promt: some default Latin web stuff

1. If you use Chrome or a Chromium-based browser, click the "lock" icon by the website's
    url. Select "Cookies".

2. There are two urls:
    ringzer0ctf.com
    ringzer0team.com

3. There's nothing under the ringzer0team.com, but when you click on 
    ringzer0ctf.com > Cookies, there's a Cookie called "flag" with content '0'.

4. When you click on other cookies, some other cookies' content is 1 or other none-zero
    values. Try changing the "flag" cookie to 1.

5. Go to Inspect > "Console" tab and enter the following to change the cookie's value:
    document.cookie = "flag=1"

6. Refresh the page and you will see the Latin is replaced with the Flag!
