** Looking for the password file **
by jhoohoo

1. The challenge takes us to http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10075/?page=lorem.php

2. I cliked inspect... and didn't really find anything on the html, so I started wondering
    about how I can get to the password file.

3. I noticed the url of the page is page=lorem.php, and conventionally, Unix password file
    is /etc/passwd.

4. The Flag is at one of the entries in 
    http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10075/?page=/etc/passwd
