**File recovery**

After unzipping the files flag.enc and private.pem, open private.pem.

In private.pem, you will see an RSA private key with PEM format.

Use openssl and this RSA private key to decrypt flag.enc.

rsautl - RSA utility
inkey - the input key file, by default it should be an RSA private key
in filename - the input filename to read data from

$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in flag.enc
