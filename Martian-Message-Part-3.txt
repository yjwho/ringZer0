1. Upon first looking at this, the string is 36 characters long. Since it's a multiple 
    of 4, it could be encoded with base64. 

2. After base64 decoding using https://www.base64decode.org/, I got:
    EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R

3. "EOBD" looks suspicious. EOBD might map to "FLAG". But how?

4. I used an XOR calculator https://toolslick.com/math/bitwise/xor-calculator and tested
    E against F
    O against L
    B against A
    D against G

5. The result is:
    E      1000101
    F      1000110
    Output 0000011 = 3

    O	   1001111
    L	   1001100
    Output 0000011 = 3

    You get the idea. I need to XOR every character in "EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R" 
    with decimal value '3'.

6. I wrote the following code to XOR:
    xor = 'EOBD.7igq4;1ikb51ibOO0;:41R'
    flag = ''

    for i in xor:
        flag = flag + chr(ord(i) ^ 3)
    print(flag)

7. The result is: FLAG-4jdr782jha62jaLL38972Q
